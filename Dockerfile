# 22: better-sqlite3 needs it, and Node 20 is past end of life.

# ---- deps: install node_modules, compiling better-sqlite3 ----
# better-sqlite3 is a native module and builds from source on install,
# which needs a compiler and Python. They live in this stage only; the
# image that runs copies the finished node_modules and nothing else.

# builds an image that can't start. Opening a database here makes a
# broken install fail the build instead of the deploy.
